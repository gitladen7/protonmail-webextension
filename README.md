# Protonmail Unofficial Webextension

## Download
Please build your own or if you insist, you can download the compiled zips from the root folder.
Current plugins available as extensions are now working because the ProtonMail changed the domain.

## Building
run `npm i && npm run build:firefox` or `npm i && npm run build:chromium`. Extension will compile to ./build, run `npm run deploy` to create the packed extensions zip.
